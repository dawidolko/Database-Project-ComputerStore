      <h3>Ready-Made Gaming PC Set</h3>
      <p>Choosing a ready-made computer set is an ideal solution for those who prefer not to risk selecting components themselves or assembling them into a functioning unit. However, many off-the-shelf products can be traps for inexperienced users, lured by attractive prices but unaware of potential quality issues or outdated components.</p>
      
      <p>As gamers ourselves with over a decade of experience, we've completed hundreds, if not thousands, of set orders. This allows us to expertly select components and configure the system so that the computer delivered to you only requires pressing the POWER button to start enjoying virtual gameplay.</p>
      
      <p>With your purchased set, we perform several activities for you. We install the operating system (unactivated Windows 10), all necessary drivers, and make essential updates, including BIOS updates for enhanced security and performance. Depending on the components chosen, we also perform overclocking to safely boost performance in games and applications.</p>
      
      <p>You can rest assured about transport. The ordered set will be delivered by an insured courier, with the computer's interior protected to prevent mechanical damage to the components even in case of accidental drops. These protections must be removed before the first startup.</p>
      
      <p>We provide a Door-to-Door warranty for the purchased set, meaning that in the event of a component failure, we'll collect the defective part or the entire computer from you and service it according to the manufacturer's warranty terms.</p>
