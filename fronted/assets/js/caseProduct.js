        <h3>Fury Shobo SH4F RGB Black computer case</h3>
        <p>Check out <strong>Fury Shobo SH4F RGB</strong> - a clever computer case with efficient cooling and RGB backlighting. Compatible with ATX motherboards and water cooling systems (AIO 360/280/240/140/120), Shobo SH4F RGB includes as many as 4 RGB fans, a mesh front and dust protection.</p>
        <p>The futuristic, geometric shape will appeal to both hardcore gamers and supporters of a more subdued design. The left side panel made of tempered glass allows you to display the inside of the case and the powerful components hidden inside - also with RGB, especially since the installed fans are factory-illuminated.</p>
        <h4>Low temperatures, high efficiency</h4>
        <p>Thanks to 4 efficient 120 mm RGB fans (one at the back, three at the front) and an open top and mesh front, Shobo SH4F RGB ensures free air flow through the housing. Combined with the possibility of installing an air CPU cooler up to 161 mm and a total of 8 fans (3 × front, 2 × top, 1 × rear, 2 × bottom), we get efficient cooling that can handle really powerful components.</p>
        <h4>High cooling</h4>
        <p>Do you want to expand your fragging machine with efficient water cooling? With Fury Shobo SH4F RGB it's child's play. The housing allows you to install AIO LC coolers with the following sizes: front (360/280/240/140/120 mm), top (240/120 mm) and rear (120 mm). Such wide compatibility means freedom in selecting components - even the most powerful ones that require really high-end cooling.</p>
        <h4>Effective dust barrier</h4>
        <p>Dust penetrating the interior of the case is the nightmare of every computer system. With Fury Shobo SH4F RGB you don't have to worry about that anymore. The housing is completely filtered against dust: from the top and bottom, and the "mesh" front has very dense meshes with a diameter clearly below 1 mm, providing protection against dirt and facilitating free air flow.</p>
        <h4>Great possibilities in a small housing</h4>
        <p>While maintaining small external dimensions, the Shobo SH4F RGB case offers full compatibility with ATX, micro-ATX and mini-ITX motherboards. You can fit in it a powerful graphics card up to 330 mm long, up to 3 drives/media (HDD/SSD) and a CPU air cooler up to 161 mm. Two-chamber design with a "basement" for the power supply and numerous cable entries mean no mess and easy organization of components.</p>

    <h3>ENDORFY Arx 500 ARGB Case</h3>
    <p>Housings are our middle name. We've been on this topic for years and it's hard to impress us, but the sight of ENDORFY Arx 500 ARGB gives us goosebumps. It's out of pride - although some say it's because of the low temperature inside the housing.</p>
    
    <p>We have included our best solutions (including 4 Stratus 140 PWM ARGB). As a result, you get one of the largest (486×228×429 mm, i.e. slightly shorter than the Arx 700 series) ENDORFY cases - with room for a tall cooling system (up to 179 mm), 7 fans and most available graphics cards (up to 350 mm). The outside is also great - with a tempered glass window and front and top panels that act as filters, our ENDORFY Arx 500 ARGB can become a housing master.</p>
    
    <h3>Come get some fresh air!</h3>
    <p>We all know that long hours at work and on the battlefield (yes, there is a difference) = welded components that beg for a break over time. With the Arx 500 ARGB you don't have such actions - the housing helps keep them pleasantly cool even when you take out the components as much as the factory provided.</p>
    
    <p>This is due to the spacious interior, which can accommodate as many as 7 air conditioners and fans. Additionally, the housing panels act as filters - so you don't need additional protection against dust. Compared to traditional solutions, this single layer allows for better air circulation and makes it easier to keep the components in a pleasant draft (because cooling is extremely important to us).</p>
    
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings of the Gales</h3>
    <p>When you look inside the Arx 500 ARGB, you immediately see that there is a specific team of cooling fans working inside. We packed 4 Stratus 140 PWM ARGBs in it - created in cooperation with Synergy Cooling, so you can be sure of adequate air flow and low temperature. Because winter never surprises us.</p>
    
    <p>The Stratus 140 PWM ARGB is our favorite. It's 14 cm tall, has an optional semi-passive mode and a durable FDB bearing, so you can count on quiet and smooth operation even in extreme conditions. We also added a splitter to control the fan speed using a PWM signal from one motherboard connector. With such a package, you are like a real Lord of the Rings of the Gales.</p>
    
    <h3>Panels with filters <3</h3>
    <p>If we were to talk about the best - in our opinion - option in the Arx 500 ARGB, we would choose excellent ventilation. This is provided, among others, (right after great fans) by panels made of finely perforated sheet metal. Some people will probably say that they can be replaced with put-on filters - but the truth is that the double anti-dust layer limits the air flow like metal armor in LARPs.</p>
    
    <p>And no one likes to have welded... components.</p>
    
    <p>That's why we made sure that the panels (front and top) in our case act as filters. This single protective layer makes the inside of the case as cool as a winter morning, and you don't have to install additional dust protection. Additionally, you can remove each filter and clean it with a cloth or a vacuum cleaner (or rinse it under running water) - and it will take you literally a moment.</p>
    
    <h3>Mister of casings</h3>
    <p>We've already said it, but we'll say it again - if there is ever a Mr. Housing election, the Arx 500 ARGB has a chance to be on the podium. All we need to do is turn on the ARGB-lit fans inside and the title is ours. The tempered glass side highlights them like a dream.</p>
    
    <h3>Everything's all right!</h3>
    <p>If someone asked us to describe the Arx 500 ARGB in three words, we would say: "Everything is fine!" Literally - it's one of our largest cases, so it easily fits everything that's most important to you. Of course, we mean components.</p>
    
    <p>Arx 500 ARGB is 486×228×429 mm, so you can pack a lot inside - for example, a tall cooling system (up to 179 mm), 7 fans (including 4 you get from us at the start) and most graphics cards available on the market (up to 350mm). There will also be a large power supply - you can mount it in the position that is most convenient for you. Its installation is not a philosophy, because we have added, among other things, a dedicated mounting frame.</p>
    
    <h3>Light at the end of the housing tunnel</h3>
    <p>Equipment without backlight is ok, but it's nice to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes. With Arx 500 ARGB you have this option - with just one click (the RESET button on the top of the housing is responsible for control), your components will be illuminated with a cosmic glow. Thank your ARGB fans for that.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks to 4 Stratus 140 PWM ARGB lights (we installed them in the housing for you), you can freely configure the backlight. You can set them up in just a moment thanks to the built-in PWM and ARGB controllers - everything is immediately connected into one working whole, compatible with ENDORFY products with the ARGB mark (and compatible products from other manufacturers), so you can easily synchronize the backlight of the entire set based on Arx 500 ARGB.</p>
